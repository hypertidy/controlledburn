Description: Rasterize without materializing any pixel values. Rasterization of polygons starts with classifying
 pixels by polygon, and in terms of scanline algorithms this is natively stored very efficiently as an index
 of start and stops of edges by scanline. We produce these intermediate structures, so they can 
 be used as an efficient format of polygon rasterization, or for the complement of this, data extraction from 
 materialized rasters. This package was derived from 'fasterize', removing Armadillo and the raster package.
