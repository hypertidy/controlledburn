Description: Rasterize polygons without materializing any pixel values.
    Computes exact coverage fractions for polygon-grid intersections and
    returns results in a sparse two-table format: run-length encoded
    interior cells and individually weighted boundary cells. The scanline
    algorithm is O(perimeter) in both time and memory. Uses the exactextract
    algorithm by Daniel Baston, vendored from the 'exactextractr' package.
    Derived from the 'fasterize' package by Noam Ross.
